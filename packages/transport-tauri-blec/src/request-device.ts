/**
 * Single unified cross-kind scan+picker for Tauri Android, the counterpart
 * to `@dg-kit/transport-webbluetooth`'s `requestDgLabDevice()`. Runs ONE
 * plugin-blec scan across every known DG-Lab device kind's name prefix,
 * presents ONE host-supplied picker (`scanAndSelectDevice()` — the same
 * `selectDevice`/`DeviceSelectionController` pattern `TauriBlecDeviceClient`
 * and `connectTauriAuxDevice()` already use), and auto-detects which kind
 * was picked via `detectDeviceKind()` — instead of the caller having to
 * already know the kind before scanning (which is what forced the
 * interim "pick a kind first" flow both DG-Agent's and DG-Chat's Android
 * shells shipped with).
 *
 * Unlike the Web Bluetooth version, kind detection happens BEFORE connecting
 * — plugin-blec's scan already hands back each device's advertised name, so
 * an unrecognized device is rejected without ever dialing plugin-blec's
 * `connect()`, rather than connecting first and disconnecting on a bad kind.
 *
 * Returns `{ kind, device, server }`, mirroring `requestDgLabDevice()`'s
 * return shape as closely as this package's `(device, server)` pair shape
 * (see `createGattShim()`) allows. Route the result to the matching client's
 * `connectDevice(device, server)` passthrough — `TauriBlecDeviceClient` for
 * `coyote`, `TauriBlecOpossumClient` for `opossum`, `TauriBlecPawPrintsClient`
 * / `TauriBlecCivetEdgingClient` (via the shared `TauriBlecSensorClient`
 * base) for `paw-prints` / `civet-edging`.
