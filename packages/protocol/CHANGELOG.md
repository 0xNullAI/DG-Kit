## 1.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 0e6657b: Complete the Coyote↔Opossum tool symmetry (5 tools each): new `vibrate_change_pattern`（切换振动节奏）switches a channel's rhythm preset without touching intensity (the vibrate counterpart of `shock_change_wave`), and new `vibrate_burst`（振动脉冲）briefly raises a channel to a target intensity then auto-restores (the counterpart of `shock_burst`).

  `OpossumVibrateAdapter` gains `vibrateBurst(channel, intensity, durationMs)` with the exact semantics of Coyote's `runBurst`: the restore target is `min(current, previous)` so an intervening stop or manual decrease is never pushed back up by a late-firing timer; a second burst on the same channel supersedes the first's restore; `emergencyStop()` and `onDisconnected()` cancel pending restores. `OpossumCommand` gains `vibrateSetPattern` and `vibrateBurst` variants, and `isDeviceToolName` recognizes the two new tool names.

  `vibrate_start` keeps its optional `pattern` parameter for cold starts, but its description now points mid-run rhythm changes at `vibrate_change_pattern`; `shock_change_wave`'s cross-reference likewise now names the dedicated tool instead of the old re-call-vibrate_start workaround.

## 1.8.1

### Patch Changes

- f85b923: `OPOSSUM_VIBRATION_PATTERNS` was added in 1.8.0 but never re-exported from the package's public `index.ts` — every downstream consumer importing from `@dg-kit/protocol` (rather than reaching into `dist/opossum.js` directly) couldn't actually access it despite it being documented as part of the new vibration-pattern API. Fixed; added a public-API-surface test to catch this class of gap going forward.

## 1.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 500648d: Full byte-level audit of all five 47L12x-family protocol docs (Coyote V2/V3, paw-prints, civet-edging, opossum) against this implementation surfaced a real bug: the Opossum vibration controller's `setIntensity()`/`vibrate_start` only ever wrote the 0xB3 "displayed strength" command. The actual motor drive comes from 0xB0, a 20-byte waveform packet that must be re-sent every 100ms — since `OpossumVibrateAdapter` never streamed it, the device reported itself as "on" while the motor never received anything to play.

  `OpossumVibrateAdapter` now drives an internal 100ms tick loop (via the new shared `ProtocolTickLoop`, extracted from `BaseCoyoteProtocolAdapter`'s previously-inline Worker/`setInterval` mechanism) that streams 0xB0 automatically whenever either channel's intensity is above zero, and writes one final all-zero frame when both return to zero. `setIntensity`/`adjustIntensity`/`emergencyStop`'s external contract is unchanged — this is a fire-and-forget fix, not a new calling convention.

  Two more real bugs fixed on the same device: the connect-time handshake's init packet double-duties under Opossum's opcode table as "disable button-press reporting," so 0xD0 button events never arrived — `onConnected` now explicitly re-enables reporting. And the 0xB2 screen-sync command existed but was never called, so the on-device strength display never matched actual state — it's now sent after every `setIntensity()` call and every incoming 0xB3 notification.

  New capability: named vibration-rhythm presets (`constant`, `pulse`, `wave`, `ramp`, `heartbeat`, exported as `OPOSSUM_VIBRATION_PATTERNS`) drive the B0 stream's per-channel envelope independently of intensity. `OpossumVibrateAdapter.setVibrationPattern(channel, pattern)` is the new adapter-level API; `OpossumCommand`'s `vibrateStart` variant gains an optional `pattern?: OpossumVibrationPatternName` field, and `@dg-kit/tools`'s `vibrate_start` tool accepts a matching optional `pattern` enum parameter. Arbitrary caller-supplied envelopes are deliberately not exposed to tool callers — only the named presets — so an LLM can change rhythm without being able to submit an unpleasant or startling raw amplitude sequence.

  Also from the same audit, on paw-prints (爪印): the doc requires writing a "no trigger mode" 0x50 command immediately after connecting or the device may proactively drop the BLE connection — `onConnected` now sends it. And 0x51 status notifications (the device's only battery source; it has no dedicated battery GATT service) now fold their battery byte into `SensorState.battery`, which previously stayed frozen at 0.

  Internal refactors, no behavior change: `WaveCursor<TFrame, TStep>` (generic per-channel frame-queue stepping, extracted from `BaseCoyoteProtocolAdapter.advanceWaveStep`) is now shared between Coyote's wave stepper and Opossum's new pattern cursor. `clampNumber` (extracted to `gatt-utils.ts`) replaces duplicated clamp logic in both adapters. `OpossumVibrateAdapter.onConnected` now reuses the shared `connectSensorGatt`/`disconnectSensorGatt` sequence instead of its own byte-for-byte-identical duplicate.

  Small fix: the V3-family connect handshake's MTU request moves from 140 to 144, matching the opossum doc's specific recommendation (harmless best-effort negotiation for the rest of the family too).

## 1.7.1

### Patch Changes

- c1a9719: Fix a real "当前环境不支持连接郊狼设备" / `NotFoundError: No Services matching UUID ... found in Device` failure on first-time Web Bluetooth pairing: `WebBluetoothDeviceClient.connectDevice()` called `getPrimaryService()` immediately after `gatt.connect()` resolved, with no retry — but Chrome's Web Bluetooth can resolve `gatt.connect()` before its internal GATT service cache is guaranteed populated, especially on a fresh pairing.

  `@dg-kit/transport-tauri-blec` already had a `runWithGattReadyRetry` helper for the identical race on Android (plugin-blec's `connect()` has the same "resolves before service discovery" gap). That retry logic moves to `@dg-kit/protocol` (transport-agnostic — it only wraps a `() => Promise<void>` attempt with a delay+retry loop matching known transient-error message patterns) and is now also applied to `WebBluetoothDeviceClient.connectDevice()`. `@dg-kit/transport-tauri-blec`'s own `gatt-ready.ts` becomes a re-export for backward compatibility.

  New `WebBluetoothDeviceClientOptions.gattReadyRetryOptions` lets callers tune the retry (mainly for tests); defaults match the Tauri side (300ms initial delay, 3s total retry budget, 250ms interval).

### Patch Changes

- fad835c: Internal refactor: extract the GATT connect/disconnect sequence shared byte-for-byte by `PawPrintsSensorAdapter` and `CivetPressureSensorAdapter` (open write/notify characteristics, wire notification listener, run the V3-family handshake, best-effort battery read; and the matching teardown) into `connectSensorGatt`/`disconnectSensorGatt` in `gatt-utils.ts`. No public API or behavior change — each adapter's own state-transition semantics (e.g. paw-prints preserving the attempted device name on a failed connect, civet-edging auto-starting pressure streaming) are untouched.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9f49180: Add `DeviceKind`, `SensorState`, and `detectDeviceKind()` — the shared foundation for supporting the other 47L12x-family devices (paw-prints sensor, civet-edging sensor, opossum vibrate controller) alongside Coyote. Also adds `WebBluetoothSensorAdapter<TReading>`, a narrower adapter contract for event/telemetry-pushing sensor devices, and `DG_LAB_REQUEST_DEVICE_OPTIONS`, a scan filter covering all known device prefixes. All additive — existing Coyote-only `DeviceState`/`DeviceCommand`/`CoyoteProtocolAdapter` are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- d14a78a: Clamp the 47L12x-family indicator LED color byte to the documented 0-7 discrete enum (0=off, 1=yellow, 2=red, 3=purple, 4=blue, 5=cyan, 6=green, 7=white) in `paw-prints.setLedSolid`/`setLedBlink`, `civet-edging.setIndicatorColor`/`startPressureReporting`/`stopPressureReporting`, and `opossum.setLed`. Previously these accepted any 0-255 byte with no defined meaning past 7, which let a naive 0-255 color picker (or a malformed remote-control message) send an undefined value to real hardware.
- 3cc9922: Multi-agent code review of the paw-prints/civet-edging/opossum/handshake work found and fixed several real bugs before publish:
  - **The three new device adapters never ran the connect-time handshake** PR #3 added for Coyote V3 — since they share the exact same 47L12x GATT skeleton, this reproduced the same "device won't respond" symptom for newer firmware on paw-prints/civet-edging/opossum too. Extracted the handshake (and the write-fallback-chain helper, previously copy-pasted four times) into a shared `gatt-utils.ts` module all four adapters now use.
  - **`CoyoteProtocolAdapter` (the facade) silently routed non-Coyote devices to the V3 adapter** — a scanned paw-prints/civet-edging/opossum device fed through the facade would get Coyote-shaped B0/BF writes. Now throws a clear error via `detectDeviceKind()` instead of misrouting.
  - **`transport-webbluetooth`'s default scan filter** still only listed Coyote name prefixes, so civet-edging/opossum devices wouldn't appear in the Web Bluetooth chooser unless a caller explicitly passed `DG_LAB_REQUEST_DEVICE_OPTIONS`. Now defaults to the broader filter.
  - **`transport-tauri-blec`'s `forceTeardown()` (disconnect racing an in-flight reconnect) skipped the emergency-stop-before-disconnect safety step** that a normal `disconnect()` does — a user disconnecting mid-reconnect could leave the device running at its last commanded strength with no way to remotely stop it.
  - Civet-edging's `set_indicator_color` tool support had no way to change the LED color without forcing the pressure stream on or off as a side effect (there's no separate color-only opcode) — added `setIndicatorColor()`, which preserves the current streaming state.
  - Opossum's connect-failure cleanup path left a live GATT notification subscription dangling if a step after `startNotifications()` threw. Added `adjustIntensity()` so `vibrate_adjust`-style callers get an atomic read-modify-write instead of composing `getState()` + `setIntensity()` themselves (avoids a lost-update race between two concurrent adjusts).

- 4af7814: Fix Coyote V3 devices failing to respond after an official-app firmware update. Devices now receive the same connect-time handshake the official app sends (init packet on the write characteristic, best-effort subscription to legacy/OTA notify channels, MTU bump to 140) before normal B0/BF control writes begin. Adds an optional `requestMTU` hook to `BluetoothRemoteGATTServerLike` for transports that support MTU negotiation.

## 1.2.0

### Patch Changes

- ea1d12d: Harden `@dg-kit/transport-tauri-blec` for Android shell consumers. Three behaviour fixes; all are additive and require no consumer code changes.
  - **`TauriBlecDeviceClient.disconnect()` now zeroes the device before tearing down BLE.** Mirrors `transport-webbluetooth`'s flow: `protocol.emergencyStop()` runs first so a user-initiated disconnect never leaves Coyote V3 running at its last commanded strength (V3 retains state across drops). Previously a `disconnect()` would just close the GATT link.
  - **GATT-shim `gatt.disconnect()` now fires `gattserverdisconnected` synchronously.** Matches Web Bluetooth observable behaviour. plugin-blec's `disconnect()` is async and not all platforms invoke its `onDisconnect` callback on a user-initiated tear-down, so the shim now fires the event itself and dedupes against a later plugin callback.
  - **Scan result change detection covers name / connection state / services**, not only RSSI. Picker UIs now refresh when devices flip `isConnected` mid-scan or surface late service UUIDs.

  No public API additions; existing test suite extended from 43 to 47 tests.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 22de7a5: Add `@dg-kit/transport-tauri-blec` — Tauri 2 BLE `DeviceClient` backed by `@mnlphlp/plugin-blec`. Mirrors `transport-webbluetooth` for non-browser runtimes (Tauri Android primary target). Synthesizes `BluetoothRemoteGATT*Like` shapes from plugin-blec's flat API so the Coyote protocol layer is unchanged.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 340e495: First stable release. Three downstream consumers — DG-Agent (browser AI controller), DG-Chat (P2P multi-user room), and DG-MCP (Model Context Protocol server) — have all migrated onto the published `@dg-kit/*` packages and verified end-to-end against real Coyote 2.0 / 3.0 hardware. The public API (DeviceCommand shape, BaseCoyoteProtocolAdapter / WebBluetoothProtocolAdapter interfaces, ToolRegistry, RateLimitPolicy, WaveformLibrary, design-segment primitives, .pulse parser) is now considered stable; breaking changes will only ship as 2.x.

### Patch Changes

  - @dg-kit/core@1.0.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 55017d6: Add `setLimits(limitA, limitB)` to `BaseCoyoteProtocolAdapter` (and the V2 / V3 / facade implementations). On V3 it re-sends the BF init packet so the device enforces the new soft-limit; on V2 it updates state for the next tick to clamp against. Reducing a limit also clamps the current strength downward immediately. This unblocks DG-Chat's per-channel safety cap UI in Phase 4b.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 39d6853: Fix published `package.json` so `main` / `types` / `exports` point to `dist/`. The previous 0.1.0 tarballs had `main: src/index.ts` from the unsupported `publishConfig.main` override pattern, which broke `import` resolution for downstream consumers. Local dev now requires `npm run build` before `typecheck` / `test` (wired automatically via `pretypecheck` / `pretest`).
